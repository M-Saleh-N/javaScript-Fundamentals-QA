//What is event bubbling in JavaScript?

//Event bubbling is a process in JavaScript where an event triggered by an element is passed up through 
// the DOM tree to parent elements until it is handled. This is in contrast to event capturing,
// where the event is passed down the DOM tree from the parent to the child.
